# 🪵 WHO'S GONNA CARRY THE BOATS? AND THE LOGS!!

A **Goggins-inspired Habit Tracker** built to keep you accountable when motivation dies.

This project helps you **track your habits, streaks, and consistency**, while getting punched in the face (lovingly) by **David Goggins-style quotes** that remind you to stop making excuses and keep going.

No fluff.  
No comfort.  
Just discipline.
